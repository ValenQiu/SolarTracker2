# Sun Tracker & Visualizer

This is a useful Python package for tracking and visualizing the sun angle (zenith and azimuth, and other data as well) based on the `pvlib`.

## Package Introduction
In this package, there are two codes in this folder, which is the [Solar.py](Solar.py) and the [Solar_days.py](Solar_dats.py).

The `Solar.py` will update the current sun angles in an interval, and visualize the zenith and azimuth in to a 3D plot.

The `Solar_days.py` can extract the sun data in a period of time, and play the animation of the sun's path in the 3D plot. Detail sun information can be found in the [solar_positions.csv](solar_positions.csv).
